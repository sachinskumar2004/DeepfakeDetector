## 📌 Project Overview

Deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to distinguish authentic content from AI-generated manipulation. **DeepfakeDetector** addresses this by continuously analyzing on-screen content — reels, shorts, images, and videos — and flagging manipulated faces the moment they appear, without ever sending data off the device.

Instead of requiring a user to manually upload a photo or video for analysis, the app watches the screen the way a person already does: passively, while scrolling through normal content. It captures the visible frame, finds any faces, runs them through an on-device model, and raises an alert immediately if something looks synthetic.

> Most existing deepfake detectors follow an *upload → server processing → result* pipeline. DeepfakeDetector flips this into *watch normally → automatic detection → instant warning*, entirely on-device.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect deepfake content in real time, as it's being viewed
- Reduce the spread of misinformation and digital fraud
- Provide on-device inference with zero cloud dependency
- Preserve user privacy — nothing is uploaded, stored, or shared
- Stay lightweight and fast enough for everyday mobile use

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Real-Time Screen Monitoring
Continuously monitors the screen once permission is granted, using Android's `MediaProjection` API to capture frames at regular intervals (roughly every 2–3 seconds) and analyze only the content currently visible — no manual upload required. This means it works passively while watching reels, shorts, social posts, or any on-screen video or image.

### 🧵 Background Detection Service
Runs as a foreground/background service so detection continues even after the user switches to another app. Tap **Start Detection** once, and protection persists in the background until **Stop Detection** is pressed — no need to keep the app open.

### 👤 Face Detection (ML Kit)
Before any deepfake analysis happens, Google's ML Kit locates and crops faces from each captured frame, so only the relevant face region — not the entire screenshot — is passed to the model. This keeps inference fast, reduces battery drain, and improves accuracy by removing irrelevant background pixels.

### 🤖 AI-Based Deepfake Classification
The cropped face image is passed to a TensorFlow Lite model trained on real and fake facial data, which analyzes facial patterns and textures to classify the content as **Real** or **Fake** — entirely on-device, with no internet connection required.

### 🔄 Scroll Detection & Smart Frame Analysis
One of the more distinctive features: the app compares consecutive screenshots to detect when the user has scrolled, swiped, or switched to new content. Without this, a slow-finishing prediction on an old frame could trigger an alert *after* the user has already moved to different (real) content — a confusing false positive. Scroll detection invalidates stale frames so a finished prediction is only ever shown against the content it was actually computed from. This is what makes the app usable across fast-feed platforms like Reels, Shorts, and TikTok-style scrolling, rather than just static images.

### ⚡ Smart Frame Skipping
Rather than analyzing every single frame, the app captures at intervals and skips duplicate or near-identical frames, processing only meaningful changes. This conserves battery and CPU while keeping detection responsive.

### 🚨 Instant Warning Notifications
When manipulated content is detected, the user is alerted immediately via a toast message, overlay warning, or system notification — for example:

> ⚠️ **Suspicious Content**
> This content may be AI-generated or manipulated.

### 📊 Live Confidence Score
Rather than a flat yes/no verdict, the model surfaces a probability breakdown (e.g., *Real: 12% / Fake: 88%*), giving the user transparency into how confident the prediction actually is.

### 🎚️ False Positive Reduction
A single uncertain prediction doesn't trigger a warning on its own. The app combines a confidence threshold, multi-frame verification, face quality checks, and scroll detection together to cut down on spurious alerts and keep results trustworthy.

### 📱 Multi-App Compatibility
Designed to work across the apps people actually use day to day:

| Platform | Content Type |
|---|---|
| Instagram | Reels, posts |
| YouTube | Shorts, videos |
| Facebook | Videos, posts |
| WhatsApp | Shared images |
| Browser | Embedded video/images |
| Gallery | Local photos |

### 🔒 Fully Offline, Privacy-First Architecture
All analysis — capture, detection, and classification — happens locally on the device:

- ✅ No cloud processing
- ✅ No server uploads
- ✅ No permanent image storage
- ✅ No data sharing of any kind

### 🪶 Lightweight TensorFlow Lite Model
The trained model is converted to `model.tflite`, dramatically cutting memory footprint, storage size, and inference latency compared to a full TensorFlow model — making it practical to run continuously on a phone.

### 🔋 Battery-Optimized Detection
Achieved through frame interval sampling, face-only (not full-frame) analysis, TFLite's efficient inference engine, and smart frame skipping — together allowing long-running background monitoring without draining the battery.

### 🔄 Workflow

1. User starts the Deepfake Detector service.
2. `MediaProjection` API captures screen frames periodically.
3. Scroll/change detection discards frames invalidated by scrolling or swiping.
4. Valid frames are processed using ML Kit Face Detection.
5. Detected faces are cropped and preprocessed.
6. The TensorFlow Lite model performs inference.
7. A prediction is generated — **Real** or **Deepfake** — with a confidence score.
8. If deepfake content is detected, an alert is displayed and the user is notified immediately.
9. The process repeats continuously until the service is stopped.
